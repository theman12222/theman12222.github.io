                        Yandere simulator is a shitty hitman ripoff with fetishised shit. the game is incredibly horrible and will give your computer cancer. if you decide to download this trainwreck, damage to you computer is not my fault.

                        <br/>

                        I suck at progamming so your game will run at about 15 fps (give or take) unless you have a NASA pc in which case it will run at around 30 fps.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        You use elimination methods that make no sense like an iron maiden, a kiln, and a shredder, which are all available in school for some reason. By the way, the male students are useless only female students matter.

                    <p>
                        Originally, I was not planning on allowing the player to interact with Senpai. I was imagining Yandere Simulator as a game about sabotaging a boy's love life, with no gameplay that involves befriending and romancing the boy. However, recently, I have been re-considering this.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        A lot of players have expressed that they would appreciate the ability to interact with Senpai in some way, and that it would be weird if Senpai accepted a love confession from a random stranger. I understand these sentiments, and I agree with them, to an extent.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        However, I have established that one of the protagonist's primary character traits is that 
                        <em>
                            <strong>she cannot control herself in Senpai's presence</strong>
                        </em>
                        , so directly interacting with him is simply not an option for her. If I want to allow the player to interact with Senpai, it'll have to be indirectly.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Currently, it is possible to leave anonymous letters and anonymous gifts on Senpai's desks. This way, the player can develop a bond between Senpai and the protagonist without direct interaction. The strength of this bond will probably influence the ending of the game.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Other ways to interact with Senpai have also been suggested: For example, interacting with him online, so that the protagonist could speak to him without experiencing a sensory overload and becoming overwhelmed. However, at this point in time, I have not yet committed to this plan. This is only an idea.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        I'm not ready to confirm exactly how much the player will be able to interact with Senpai in the final game.

I would love to include more environments in the game, but each environment would require modeling, texturing, sound effects, unique characters with unique animations, etc. For each environment I'd like to add to the game, I'd need a team of volunteers willing to create it, or I'd need a large budget so that I could hire some people to build more environments for me.</p>

                    <p>I would like to release Yandere Simulator on as many different platforms as possible, but releasing games on console is a lot more difficult than independently releasing games on PC, and I would probably need the help of a publisher in order to release Yandere Simulator on any console.</p>
                    <p>
                        At this point in time, I am only able to release builds for Windows PC. There are two main reason for this:
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        1) I don't own any computers using the Mac or Linux operating systems. If I exported a Mac / Linux build, I'd have no way to test it. I'd just be throwing a build onto the Internet and praying that people can run it, with no real way to debug it if it doesn't work.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        2) Yandere Simulator is developed using the Unity game engine. Within Unity, the process of switching from one platform (Windows) to another platform (Mac, Linux) requires Unity to re-import every one of the game's assets. Yandere Simulator is a huge game with thousands of assets, so when I click the button to switch from one platform to another button, it hangs there for about 15 minutes. Exporting a new build takes 15 minutes, too. It's simply too time-consuming to export PC+Mac+Linux every time I want to make a new build, especially when I can't even test the Mac or Linux builds.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        I can't justify working on multiple platforms right now; so I will be maintaining my focus exclusively on PC for the time being. I won't begin to consider exporting Mac or Linux builds of the game until after the first official rival is implemented.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        Regarding the possibility of releasing Yandere Simulator for mobile phones...Yandere Simulator may seem like a simple game on the surface, but it is actually an extremely complex game. It is extremely unlikely that a mobile device such as an iPhone or Android could ever run the full version of Yandere Simulator. In order to run on a mobile device, the game would have to be simplified so much that it wouldn't even be the same game anymore.

                        Yandere Simulator will be free until I am ready to include two rivals in the game. After that point, the game will have so much content that it will no longer be reasonable to give it away for free, and I'll have to start charging money for it. After the second rival has been implemented, but before the final release date of the game, Yandere Simulator will be sold for a very cheap price (probably something along the lines of $5).

                        The price and release date of the final game will depend on a lot of different factors that are too difficult to estimate at this point in time.

                    <p>
                        When I first came up with the kidnapping idea, the plan was that it would only be possible for the player to kidnap 
                        <em>rivals</em>
                        .
                    </p>
                    <p>I wanted to be able to test the kidnapping feature without implementing a rival first, so I made it possible to kidnap any female student. I always considered the ability to kidnap any female student to be a temporary / placeholder feature that was only implemented for testing purposes.</p>
                    <p>However, now that the Yakuza has been implemented and part of his functionality involves the ability to purchase kidnapped victims, it seems as though the "kidnap non-rivals" feature has become official. So, with that in mind, now I have to begin to consider whether or not it should be possible to kidnap males.</p>
                    <p>Currently, I don't have any strong feelings about whether I do or do not want to support that feature. However, I don't actually have all of the animations that I'd need in order to make it possible to kidnap males. So, it's not something I could implement at this point in time, even if I wanted to do so.</p>

To design a challenging experience for the player, I need complete control over exactly where a student will be standing, and exactly when they will be standing there.

                        The game's current "Easter Eggs" aren't really hidden; you just open a menu and press a button to activate them. In the future, I think that the player should have to meet some very, very specific criteria to activate an easter egg - for example, dismembering 10 students' arms in order to unlock the "Demon Arms" easter egg. The player might also have to enter a cheat code at the main menu to enable the use of easter eggs or supernatural events. Entering this cheat code and using an easter egg would prevent the playing from being able to acquire any Achievements, and would result in a "non-canon" joke ending. The only way to get a proper ending would be to avoid the use of any cheats or easter eggs.

                        As for debug commands, there might be a way to access them in the final game, but it will involve entering a password at the title screen (and will disable Achievements).

                        <br/>

                        3b. Then, if there is demand for a sequel, a prequel, or a spinoff game, I may begin developing Yandere Simulator 2.

                        3b. However, if there is no demand for DLC / spinoffs, then I won't bother making either.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        4a. By the time Yandere Simulator is finished, I'll have all of the assets necessary to create a game set in a Japanese-style school environment. So, I might create a game that re-uses many of the assets used to create Yandere Simulator.
                        <br/>

                        4b. However, by the time Yandere Simulator is finished, I might be sick of Japanese school settings, and I might never want to make a similar game ever again. In this case, my next game will be completely unrelated to Japanese schools.

                    <ul>
                        <li>From an aesthetic standpoint, I dislike the way they look; their necks are super short, and their proportions make them look more like middle-schoolers than the 18-year-old young adults that they are actually supposed to be.</li>
                        <li>From a practical standpoint, their faces don't have much flexibility, so they lack the ability to express extreme emotions, and aren't able to be very expressive in general.</li>
                        <li>From a technical standpoint, some parts of their bodies are super low-poly, which makes them look really weird when I rotate or resize those parts of the model.</li>
                        <li>From a game design standpoint, it would be better to have models that are custom-designed for the purposes that the models need to be used for (for example, if I want to make it possible to chop off students' limbs, the character models should be built with that feature in mind).</li>
                        <li>And from yet another standpoint, it's just super inconvenient that their clothing is combined with their bodies. It would be better to have a single "base" model and then a variety of clothing models.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For all of these reasons - and more - I want a new set of character models to be created for Yandere Simulator. (I would like to keep the same general "art style" of the current models, but with a few tweaks to make them more appealing.)</p>
                    <p>However, whether or not Yandere Simulator gets new character models is dependent on the outcome of the game's crowdfunding campaign, so it's currently impossible to promise whether or not it will actually happen, or when it will happen.</p>

                <div class="faq-body-container">
                    <p>Being able to knock someone unconscious at any time / location would create a large number of new scenarios. Here are some examples:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Students reacting to the sight of seeing someone get knocked out.</li>
                        <li>Students reacting to discovering an unconscious body.</li>
                        <li>Students attempting to wake up unconscious students.</li>
                        <li>Unconscious students waking up and reacting to their situation.</li>
                        <li>Previously-unconscious students going to the nurse's room.</li>
                        <li>End-of-day protocol for teachers who discover an unconscious student while walking around.</li>
                        <li>Protocol for Yandere-chan being punished / expelled / arrested for the crime of assaulting someone (even non-lethally).</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Each of these scenarios would involve new animations, new voiced lines, and new code. I have to be selective about what kind of features I add to the game. If one new feature (knocking someone out) has the side-effect of creating at least 7 new scenarios, then I'm unlikely to add it into the game. At this point, I'm only considering features that only create one or two new scenarios.</p>

                <div class="faq-body-container">
                    <p>I don't want every character in the game to have an identical body, but giving each character a different height can result in animation problems. For example, imagine a handshake animation between two characters that are the same height, and then imagine a handshake between a very short person and a very tall person. These two characters couldn't use the normal handshake animation; they would need to use a custom animation. Also, many killing animations involve the protagonist stabbing a certain spot on her victim's body (head, neck, heart) and if victims have different heights then the animation might look wrong. Also, if characters have different body types, then their animations might cause their arms/legs to clip into their body; for example, a very overweight student would need a different "hands on hips" animation than other students.</p>
                    <p>It would be extremely easy to make characters have different heights, but it could result in animation problems, clipping problems, etc, so it's not something I am planning on doing at this point in time. It's possible that, if the game gets new character models, the new character models might be set up in a way that allows them to easily have different body types without clipping problems. However, it's too soon to promise this.</p>

                    <p>The current matchmaking process involves Yandere-chan giving instructions to another character via an earpiece.

                    <p>Because the current matchmaking process requires one student to already have romantic feelings for another student, matchmaking can only occur between pre-determined characters. You can't just convince a random stranger to wear an earpiece and follow instructions without a really good reason. You also can't just make any two arbitrary people fall in love unless they were a good fit for one another in the first place.</p>
                    <p>At this point in time, under the current matchmaking process, it's very unlikely that the player will have the ability to make any two arbitrary characters fall in love.</p>

                        Each new feature added to the game extends the game's development time. If I keep adding every new feature that comes to mind, the game will be in development forever, and will never come out. For a long time, I've considered the idea of Yandere-chan developing stalkers, but I don't want to promise this type of feature, because I know that it would just delay development further.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        It's possible that having a high reputation might be an imbalanced feature. If the player gets too many advantages from having a high reputation, then I may decide that there should be a downside to having a high reputation; for example, having a high reputation might result in the player developing stalkers.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>

                        In other words, I'd consider the possibility of adding crushes / stalkers to the game if it would fix a game design flaw, but I wouldn't consider throwing this feature into the game without a good reason.

                    <p>An executable can be "signed" with a digital signature that identifies the creator of the executable. If an executable is signed, it's possible to learn the identity of the person who created it, and therefore hold them accountable if their executable was malicious. For this reason, signed executables are considered to be trustworthy, and unsigned executables are considered to be untrustworthy.</p>
                    <p>To "sign" an executable, you need to pay for an expensive "code signing certificate". A code-signing certificate costs hundreds of dollars per year. I have not bought one yet.</p>

It is easy for a big company buy a digital certificate, which will be used to sign software, but it's not easy for an independent developer working on a freeware app.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, it's not easy to give a meaningful answer to this question, since the outcome relies on several factors that are out of my hands. I'll explain:</p>
                    <p>After I have finished implementing the game's first rival, "Osana", I will hold a crowdfunding campaign with the intention of raising enough money to pay a team of professionals to help me complete the game. There are several potential outcomes for the crowdfunding campaign:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the crowdfunding campaign cannot meet its bare minimum goal, Yandere Simulator will have to be completed without professional assistance. I will be very limited in what I can do, so the production values will be low, and every rival will feel like a clone of Osana. The final game will feel nearly identical to the current debug sandbox, and it will most likely be released sometime in early 2021.</li>
                        <li>If the crowdfunding campaign can meet its bare minimum goal, I will be able to affored to hire professionals to assist me in completing the game. Many of the game's assets will be improved or replaced (such as the character models), the overall production values of the game will be much higher, and each rival will feel unique. Because of the additional work that will be done on the game, it will most likely be released sometime in late 2021.</li>
                        <li>If the crowdfunding campaign can meet its first "stretch goal", I will be able to hire a professional software engineer to replace me as the game's lead programmer. As a result, the speed of the game's development will increase drastically, since the rate of progress won't be hindered by my personal availability. The engineer will most likely improve many aspects of the game, as well. In this scenario, the game would most likely be released in mid 2021.</li>
                        <li>If the crowdfunding campaign can meet additional "stretch goals", I will be able to pay professionals to work on the game for a longer amount of time, which would allow the game to have "dream" features such as a female Senpai, "1980s Mode", a mode where the layout of the school can be customized, etc. Because of the time required to work on these additional features, the game would most likely be released in early 2022.</li>
                        <li>Past this point, further funding could pay for more programmers so that various responsibilities could be spread across multiple people instead of held exclusively by one person, further increasing the game's development speed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If the crowdfunding campaign fails, there are alternate ways to secure funding for the game. It's possible that I could raise money from investors (in exchange for promising them a portion of the game's profits) or partner with a company (most likely in exchange for ownership of the Yandere Simulator brand). So, if the crowdfunding campaign fails, it doesn't immediately spell doom for the project.</p>
                    <p>You can expect all of these numbers and estimates to change as we get closer to the crowdfunding campaign, and the amount of time/money/assets required to finish the game becomes more apparent.</p>

                    <p>Because the game is currently in development, it is changing all the time. I am constantly improving the performance and increasing the optimization of the code. Thus, the minimum specs are always getting lower.</p>
                    <p>It's possible to run the game with only 6GB of RAM, but it's recommended to have at least 8GB of RAM.</p>
                    <p>To run the game at over 55 FPS consistently, you'd need at least a i7 5820k processor, and at least a GTX 970 graphics card. (The hardware I just named is 6 years old.)</p>

                    <p>First, I came up with an interesting way for a person to die (like an actress being killed by a prop during a stage play) and then I designed characters around that concept (for example, making one of the rivals an aspiring actress who will perform on a stage).</p>

                <h3>How complete is the game? What percent remains?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-body">
                <div class="faq-body-container">
                    <p>This can be a tricky question, because the answer depends what type of formula is used to determine how "complete" a game is.</p>
                    <p>Yandere Simulator is composed of "gameplay elements" and "story elements". 100% of all gameplay elements are implemented. One rival is 100% finished, and 10 rivals are planned, which means that the story elements are 10% done.</p>
                    <p>In my opinion, "gameplay elements" are 90% of the game's content, and story elements are about 10% of the game's content. This means that the game is about 91% complete.</p>
                    <p>If that answer is too broad and vague to be useful, it may be a good idea to change the question being asked. "Now that all the gameplay elements are finished, how long will it take to complete the story elements?" Yandere Simulator has such an abundance of gameplay mechanics that it took 6 years to finish implementing all of the mechanics necessary to make it possible to play through the story. However, implementing a rival takes mere months, so the rest of the game's development should go by much faster. I predict that the game will reach completion in 12 to 24 months.</p>

                        <br/>

                        Or, did Raibaru lose for a completely different reason altogether?

                        Maybe you'll never know the truth. Maybe you'll find out within the game itself. That's the fun of it.

If the player prepares an elaborate plan and it is ruined by a random occurrence, the player would be very frustrated.

                    <p>Yandere Simulator is also meant to be "speedrun-friendly," meaning that it is supposed to be possible to completely plan out an entire playthrough. The addition of randomly-determined factors would interfere with the ability to speedrun the game.</p>
