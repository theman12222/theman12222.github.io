They all share a similar fashion style which was invented by their leader, Musume, who combined elements of the \"gal,\" \"gyaru,\" and \"ganguro\" fashion trends. They have been known to ruthlessly bully anyone that they see as \"beneath\" them. This bullying often goes unreported, because nobody would want to get on the Bullies' bad side and become their new target.</p>\n\n<p>The leader of the Bullies is named Mutsumi Rokuda. She is the daughter of a well-known loan shark, which has earned her the nickname \"Musume Ronshaku,\" which translates to \"Daughter Loanshark.\" Her rich father spoiled her rotten, and as a result, Musume grew up without any reason to treat others with kindness or respect. Gradually, she developed the belief that most people are \"beneath\" her, and that the \"lowest\" people are mere playthings for her to torment. Like a child who never learned the difference between right and wrong, she simply lacks the ability to see her victims as people who deserve empathy or compassion. She doesn't deliberately seek out victims, but when she spots one, she will happily seize the opportunity to treat another person like dirt.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout her life, Musume rarely had to face any sort of consequences for her poor behavior. Her father's reputation intimidated most of her teachers and classmates, so most authority figures refused to discipline her, and most kids refused to stand up to her.

She is deeply insecure about herself - everything from her appearance to her intelligence - and she feels a powerful, irresistible urge to find reasons to look down on others, so that she can feel better about herself by comparison. For this reason, she is obsessed with finding skeletons in other peoples' closets, and dragging out those skeletons for the world to see. She doesn't care what consequences her actions have in the lives of others, as long as she can feel superior to them.</p>\n\n<p>Kokoro Momoiro was a victim of severe merciless bullying at her last school, and has resolved to never be a victim again.

The firsthand knowledge of what it feels like to be bullied is still fresh in her mind, and she has absolutely no desire to abuse others, but she does it anyway...because she knows that she has to keep up the facade of being a bully in order to avoid being targeted by Musume and her friends. She has become what she hates, which has caused her to loathe herself deeply, but she would still rather hate herself than return to being harmed by others.</p>\n\n<p>Hoshiko Mizudori is different from the other members of the bullies. She has no excuse for her behavior, such as receiving a poor upraising, having an inferiority complex, or being a former victim. She is simply a <em>cruel person</em>.

During the previous year, there were five students at Akademi who were subjected to severe bullying. The school faculty was informed about the bullying, but none of the victims were able to provide concrete evidence that the bullying had been taking place, so the faculty refused to take action. The bullying eventually became so severe that the victims were considering a suicide pact. However, before this could take place, the victims witnessed something extraordinary that saved them from a self-destructive path.</p>\n\n<p>One day, outside of the entrance to the school, the bullied victims witnessed one of their fellow students - Osoro Shidesu - single-handedly fight off a group of violent aggressors from another school. Against all odds, Osoro actually managed to defeat all of her opponents, despite their superior numbers. Instantly, Osoro became an icon to them - a physical embodiment of the idea that a single person can stand against a group of tormentors and prevail. From that day forward, the bullied victims idolized Osoro.</p>\n\n<p>Osoro had demonstrated that violence was a viable solution to their problems, and that a fearsome reputation would keep their enemies away. The five bullied students began imitating Osoro; they started acting gruff, unfriendly, and standoffish, exactly like her. They dyed their hair blonde, just like hers. They styled their hair to give themselves the appearances of rebellious punks, and began carrying long, blunt objects at all times. They began showing up late to class, disrespecting faculty members, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Those five boys were originally targeted by bullies because they were the meekest students at school - and now they had become the exact opposite. Needless to say, the bullying stopped...but at a cost. The rest of the students at school began to fear them and avoid them, referring to them as \"the delinquents.\" This was exactly what they wanted; they'd much rather be feared and hated than be bullied and victimized. However, the faculty and the headmaster began to view them as a growing problem.</p>\n\n<p>The headmaster refused to accept the presence of delinquents at a prestigious school like Akademi. In a faculty meeting, he announced that he was going to expel them all, including Osoro, purely for being a negative influence. However, the guidance counselor stopped him. She regretted not stepping in and taking action while they were being bullied, and insisted on being given a chance to reform the delinquents, rather than simply expelling them without trying anything else first.</p>\n\n<p>The guidance counselor and the headmaster were able to reach an agreement: the faculty and the student council will tolerate the delinquents' behavior for a period of 10 weeks, and give the counselor a chance to reform them. However, this arrangement comes at a cost: if the counselor is unable to reform the delinquents within 10 weeks, she will be dismissed from the school.</p>\n\n<p>The counselor recognized that it would be difficult to reform the delinquents while their biggest influence - Osoro - was still present at school. The next time that Osoro slipped up, the counselor expelled her for a period of 8 weeks.</p>\n\n<p>Will the counselor be able to reform the delinquents before the deadline?

                {"name":"Dozuki Aishi","role":"Neglectful Mother","status":"Alive","personality":"Selfish","appearance":"1989","weakness":"Hard Work","description":"<p>Dozuki Aishi was born in 1950 to a pair of extremely wealthy parents. Dozuki's mother worked a highly-demanding job that required her to frequently travel overseas for long periods of time, which caused her to be absent for most of Dozuki's childhood. Dozuki's mother tried to compensate for her lengthy absences by spoiling her daughter as much as possible whenever she had the opportunity; she showered Dozuki with gifts and praise as often as possible, and never said \"no\" to anything that her daughter requested. As a result, Dozuki developed into a very spoiled young woman who was accustomed to having everything she wanted handed to her on a silver platter without ever working for it.</p>\n\n<p>Like all other members of her bloodline, Dozuki is afflicted with the \"Aishi Condition,\" a disorder which causes her to feel a perpetual sensation of emptiness, as if something crucial is missing from her life. In 1967, while attending high school, Dozuki came into physical contact with a young man whose presence could mysteriously alleviate the symptoms of her condition. Dubbing this young man her \"Senpai,\" Dozuki was determined to turn him into her lifelong companion - however, there were other girls vying for his attention, and Dozuki had no experience with romance. It appeared as though wooing this young man would require hard work, which Dozuki was firmly opposed to.</p>\n\n<p>As usual, Dozuki went crying to her mother and begged her for a solution. By this point in time, Dozuki's mother had retired from her highly-demanding job, and could afford to spend all of her time (and vast fortune) doting on her daughter. She decided that the most efficient way to fulfill Dozuki's needs was to kidnap her Senpai, break his spirit, and turn him into a sort of \"pet.\" To accomplish this, she would need two things: time and privacy. After considering all of her options, she ultimately reached the conclusion that the only way to accomplish her goal in complete secrecy would require an addition to her house: a basement.</p>\n\n<p>In Japan, homes typically do not have basements due to earthquake concerns, flooding risks, and cultural preferences. Dozuki did not wish for local authorities to be aware that she was adding a basement to her home - since it would only be used for illegal purposes and could be a liability for her in the event of a police investigation - and so it was constructed in complete secrecy with the assistance of foreigners who were paid handsomely to stay silent about what they were building. Despite the numerous difficulties in accomplishing this task, the basement was constructed within a year's time. Immediately after its completion, Dozuki's Senpai was kidnapped and imprisoned there.</p>\n\n<p>During the 1800s, one of Dozuki's ancestors discovered a torture technique that could \"break\" a person mentally. The technique does not involve physical pain; it would be most accurate to describe it as a form of hypnosis. The Aishi hypnotizes the victim into thinking that they are experiencing various types of extreme physical torture; having their fingernails torn out, having every bone in their body broken one by one, having their organs removed from their torso, being lit on fire, being drowned, etc. In reality, absolutely nothing is happening to the victim. However, in the victim's mind, they are undergoing all of the most physically painful experiences imaginable.<br /><br />\nThroughout this process, the Aishi is also doing something else - giving the victim hope that they can escape, and then yanking the hope away. The cycle of providing hope and squashing hope gradually conditions the victim to believe that there is no reason to consider resistance or imagine a better future. Once the victim is completely convinced that there is no hope, and that their life is already over, their mind enters a \"malleable\" state where they can be re-shaped into anything their captor wishes for them to be - even a pet. This is exactly what Dozuki did to her Senpai; she deliberately transformed him into a shell of a man with no will of his own - a \"mind-broken slave.\"</p>\n\n<p>With her mind-broken \"husband\" at her side, Dozuki's easy life continued as before; she lived as selfishly as possible, relied on her doting mother for all of her needs, and never worked a day in her life. In 1971, she gave birth to her first daughter, Ryoba. Dozuki had absolutely no interest in childrearing, and let her mother and husband raise the child, while doing only the bare minimum amount of work that was required of her. In 1976, she gave birth for the second and last time. Ryoba, who resented her mother for being lazy and selfish, and did not want to see her grandmother's workload increase, took it upon herself to care for her younger sister.</p>\n\n<p>For many years, Dozuki, her mother, her father, her husband, and her two daughters all lived under the same roof. However, once Ryoba found her own \"Senpai\" and eventually brought him into their home, Dozuki decided that the house had become too crowded, and that it was time for a change. However, instead of simply kicking Ryoba and her soulmate out of the house, Dozuki decided to relocate to Tokyo. She - along with her parents, husband, and daughter - moved out of Buraza Town, leaving Ryoba and her Senpai alone together in their old house. Now residing in Tokyo, Dozuki continues to live comfortably and selfishly, with her elderly mother still taking care of all her needs.</p>","illustrator":"KattyStarlitt","illustratorUrl":"https://www.deviantart.com/kattystarlitt","groups":["Aishi"],"images":[{"url":"/img/characters/grandma-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/grandma.png","name":"1989"},{"url":"/img/characters/grandma-young-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/grandma-young.png","name":"1968"}]},

His parents reluctantly permit him to live in their house as a freeloader, partially because they know he would never survive if they kicked him out, and partially because they feel responsible for his shortcomings.</p>\n\n<p>Sutemi's darkest secret is that he is physically attracted to his own biological sister. She is not aware of his feelings, but she still finds him repulsive anyway, because of his inability to socialize normally. She strongly prefers to avoid him whenever possible, which isn't difficult, because he usually spends entire weeks secluded inside of his bedroom, only leaving to use the bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>Because he knows that his sister is off-limits to him, he has directed his feelings towards a popular anime character named \"Magical Girl Pretty Miyuki\" who physically resembles his sister. What began as an appreciation of the character slowly grew into an extreme hyperfixation, and then eventually developed into a psychotic obsession; he even converted his entire room into a \"shrine\" to Miyuki.</p>\n\n<p>One day, during a trip to obtain some new Miyuki merchandise - one of the only circumstances that could ever cause him to leave his house - he witnessed Osana Najimi, a young woman attending the nearby Akademi Academy, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Miyuki. He saw her as a \"portal\" through which Miyuki could enter the real world; a way to make his \"waifu\" become real and tangible.</p>\n\n<p>Sutemi stalked Osana until he had followed her all the way to her home. Desperate to interact with her, but unwilling to do so in person, he contacted the information broker known as \"Info-chan\" and paid her generously for Osana's phone number. Once he had it, he texted her incessantly, professing his love for her. Osana was disturbed by these messages, and commanded him to stop - to no avail.</p>\n\n<p>A few days later, while spying on Osana's home, Sutemi noticed her pet kitten through a window. The sight of the animal inspired him to design a twisted plan to \"kidnap\" Osana's cat and force her to obey his commands in exchange for the feline's safety. The following day, he successfully snuck into her house through an unlocked window, stole the cat, and took it back to his home in a pet carrier.</p>\n\n<p>With the cat safely in his possession, Sutemi is confident that he can convince Osana to meet with him, whereupon he will romance her, convince her to move in with him, and dress her in Miyuki cosplay for eternity. However, he has no idea how to care for a cat, no plan if Osana refuses to cooperate, and no clue how he is going to keep any of this a secret from his parents.</p>\n\n<p>He is completely incapable of perceiving the numerous flaws with his short-sighted plan, and only time will tell what fate will befall him...</p>","illustrator":"RaineBeau","illustratorUrl":"","groups":["Others"],"images":[{"url":"/img/characters/stalker-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/stalker.png","name":"Stalker"}]},

                {"name":"Horuda Umetsu","role":"Tool","status":"Alive","personality":"Fragile","appearance":"Week 1","weakness":"Bullying","description":"<p>Horuda Umetsu has been bullied at every school she has ever attended, from kindergarten to high school. She has always been considered \"weird\" by the other children; while some thought that she was merely awkward and gloomy, others felt that she was outright creepy and scary. Strangely, nobody has ever been able to articulate exactly *why* they perceive her in this way; the only explanation offered by the other children is that they dislike her because of \"the vibe she gives off.\"</p>\n\n<p>Despite many attempts to forge bonds with other people, Horuda has never been able to succeed at making a friend - not once in her entire life. She gradually began to feel that her \"fate\" was to be alone and to be mistreated by others, and so, she eventually decided that her wisest course of action was to spend her time as far away from other people as possible. Unfortunately, her preference for solitude has only reinforced her status as \"weird and creepy\" in the eyes of others.</p>\n\n<p>A lifetime of being mistreated by others has severely impacted her mental health; she is often preoccupied with very dark thoughts, such as, \"All the people who treat me badly should just die!\" and \"I wish I could kill all of the people who have made me suffer!\" Recently, she has begun to use artwork as an outlet for these thoughts, often sketching very morbid drawings of herself torturing and murdering the people who have tormented her in various bloody and gruesome ways.</p>\n\n<p>Some people are more \"fragile\" than others - just a gentle push away from shattering into a million pieces. When someone is convinced that they have lost everything, and have nothing left to lose, they lose all reason to continue clinging to life; their mind becomes occupied by a single thought: \"Why don't I just track down the person who made my life so miserable, kill them, and then kill myself?\" This thought occupies their mind every waking hour - eating away at them until there is nothing left.</p>\n\n<p>Horuda has attracted the attention of Akademi's bullies, who have nicknamed her \"Horuda Puresu\" - a term that is meant to sound like the word \"Placeholder.\" The implication is that she has no intrinsic worth or value, and is nothing more than a \"background decoration,\" temporarily occupying a blank space that will eventually be occupied by someone more worthwhile. It's a basic and childish insult, but it's one that directly strikes at her deepest insecurities.</p>\n\n<p>If Horuda's reputation drops any further, she will be targeted by Akademi's bullies - and, although she might not show it outwardly, she would then develop a burning desire to find and kill the person responsible for damaging her reputation. Under those circumstances, this seemingly timid and docile girl could be transformed into a \"guided missile\" determined to take violent revenge on the person whom she views as responsible for her suffering...and then self-destruct.</p>","illustrator":"Kaito","illustratorUrl":"https://www.instagram.com/d_hampiir","groups":["Others"],"images":[{"url":"/img/characters/fragile-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/fragile.png","name":"Fragile"}]},
                {"name":"Bankotsuko","role":"Ramen Shop Owner","status":"Alive","personality":"Enigmatic","appearance":"Week -79,572","weakness":"Enchanted Weaponry","description":"<p>There is no shortage of books in the world that seek to enthrall the reader with fantastical stories of supernatural beings. These books are widely regarded as fairy tales for the entertainment of small children. But, on rare occasion, one might discover a book which emphatically insists that the beings from these stories are not inventions of human imagination, but truly did exist.</p>\n\n<p>This type of book - often at the cost of the author's credibility and reputation - makes the outlandish claim that mankind once shared the world with a wide variety of supernatural creatures who existed in significant numbers. However, these creatures could only subsist on human flesh, making co-existence impossible. Thus, the creatures were hunted down, nearly to complete extinction.</p>\n\n<p>Because these supernatural creatures disintegrated upon death, no credible physical evidence of their existence remains, aside from a small number of contemporary paintings that allegedly depict these creatures, and written accounts of supposed encounters with these creatures - all of which have long been debunked and discredited by academic communities.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, despite the dubious nature of these claims, there are those who choose to believe them. \"Occult Researchers\" - existing in small numbers, shunned by the rest of society - dedicate their lives to seeking empirical evidence of demons, ghosts, succubi, vampires, zombies, and any other type of supernatural being that is regarded as fictional by the rest of society.</p>\n\n<p>According to the legends that these researchers believe, these supernatural beings posed such a threat to mankind that grand academies were built to teach young men and women the skills they would need to slay monsters - including, by some accounts, actual magic spells. As usual, there is no physical evidence to support the notion that these \"monster slayer academies\" truly existed.</p>\n\n<p>Supposedly, Japan was once terrorized by paranormal beasts known as \"Oni\" until the 1800s, when a pair of elite monster slayers from the west arrived in Japan through supernatural means, and became almost single-handedly responsible for wiping out the entire monster population. This claim is not taken seriously by the Occult Research community, who have found countless holes in the story.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless of what is true or untrue, there is a portion of the population - however small - who remains convinced that supernatural creatures not only exist, but sometimes walk among us, masquerading as humans. Succubi and vampires - the most humanoid of all supernatural beings - have the highest chance of escaping notice...if one chooses to believe in such things in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>It is said that the only way to identify a non-human is to examine their pupils for unusual shapes...but, with the rising popularity of Saikou-brand cosmetic contact lenses, it is increasingly common for people to display unusually shaped pupils, thus making it unconventional to attempt to \"identify a supernatural being\" by simply pointing out the shape of a person's pupils.</p>\n\n<p>Supernatural beings do not show signs of aging after reaching maturity. If a person does not appear to age a day over the course of multiple decades, this could be seen as strong evidence that they are not human. Consequently, any supernatural being that is living in human society while masquerading as a human usually does not stay in one place for an extended period of time.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are exceptions. Occasionally, a supernatural being will find a place in the world where they feel so comfortable that they don't want to leave, despite the risk of eventually being identified as a non-human. These beings are usually benign; capable of subsisting without taking human life or causing harm to humans, and thus able to survive in human society without issue.</p>\n\n<p>And then, of course, there are even rarer exceptions - beings who possess the ability to use magic to charm humans into thinking, \"There's absolutely nothing weird about the fact that the lady who runs the ramen restaurant has remained the same age for the past 40 years. Nothing weird at all. She probably just dyes her hair and has an excellent skincare routine.\"</p>\n\n<p>Even rarer still are the beings who openly demonstrate their magic to humans, and yet are never identified as non-human. After all, can you really prove - beyond a reasonable doubt - that the ramen you got from that mysterious lady is what gave you a dream where you saw the memories of your ancestors? No, you can't; there isn't any empirical evidence...</p>\n\n<p>...and that's why Bankotsuko has managed to live for 1,525 years without being identified as a non-human.</p>","illustrator":"KattyStarlitt","illustratorUrl":"https://www.deviantart.com/kattystarlitt","groups":["Others"],"images":[{"url":"/img/characters/ramen-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/ramen.png","name":"Ramen Shop Owner"}]},
                {"name":"Kataba Aishi","role":"Doting Mother","status":"Alive","personality":"Devoted","appearance":"1989","weakness":"Criminal Record","description":"<p>Born in 1930, Kataba grew up in Imperial Japan, where her childhood was shaped by militaristic propaganda, extreme nationalism, and the devastation of World War II. She was 15 when the war ended, and the post-war years of her life were dominated by poverty, hunger, and disillusionment with her government and nation.</p>\n\n<p>In 1948, at the age of 18, Kataba became obsessed with a young man at her high school. She desired a relationship with him but faced competition from ten other girls who were also pursuing him. After using various methods — including lethal ones — to eliminate those ten girls, she confessed to the young man she loved, who accepted her feelings. However, her joy would be short-lived.</p>\n\n<p>With the war over, the United States' focus had shifted to their rising tensions with the Soviet Union, marking the beginning of the Cold War. Japan — given its geographic location and economic potential — was seen as a crucial ally in the region. The U.S. sought to ensure stability in the region and prevent hostile influences from gaining ground. For this reason — and many others — the United States maintained a presence in Japan in the post-war years.</p>\n\n<p>American intelligence agencies — especially the newly-formed \"Central Intelligence Agency\" — assisted Japanese police in investigating the mysterious deaths and disappearances of high school girls in Kataba's neighborhood. Their investigation eventually led them to identify Kataba as the serial killer they had been pursuing. However, before facing trial, she was offered a deal.</p>\n\n<p>During their investigation into Kataba's murders, the CIA had become genuinely impressed with her remarkable talent for committing various types of crimes while leaving almost no traces of her actions. The agency even started to perceive Kataba as a perfect example of the type of agent they needed for covert operations.</p>\n\n<p>After being caught, Kataba was offered a pardon for her crimes as long as she agreed to work as a \"deniable asset\" for the CIA — undertaking missions as a spy, an assassin, or whatever else the situation called for. Backed into a corner, with no way out and with very limited options, Kataba reluctantly agreed, under the condition that she would be allowed to continue seeing the young man she loved, and that he would be provided with the wealth necessary to live a comfortable life.</p>\n\n<p>After her recruitment, Kataba underwent extensive training from both Japan's intelligence apparatus and the CIA. She was taught new combat skills, as well as techniques for surveillance, counter-intelligence, sabotage, and covert assassination. Her natural abilities as a serial killer were refined and honed until she was a living weapon in the service of her new handlers.</p>\n\n<p>Kataba was deployed in regions of strategic importance, carrying out high-risk operations to ensure that stability in the region remained unthreatened. As a woman, she leveraged gender stereotypes to her advantage, going undercover in ways that male agents couldn't. When needed, she acted as a seductress, but always stayed loyal to her husband, who was patiently waiting for her back in Japan.</p>\n\n<p>Her missions included assassinations, espionage, and sabotage. She eliminated targets deemed a threat to her employers, dismantled hostile networks, and collected intelligence on foreign military operations. She did not enjoy doing dirty work for the CIA, but after experiencing the horrors of war firsthand throughout her childhood, she was determined to do everything in her power to maintain stability in the region and prevent the flames of war from re-igniting once more.</p>\n\n<p>She gave birth to a daughter in 1950, but due to the need to constantly visit other countries for long periods of time, she was absent for much of her daughter's early childhood. She was deathly afraid that her daughter would never be able to develop any love for her, and attempted to compensate for her long absences by spoiling her daughter rotten at every opportunity she had.</p>\n\n<p>By the early '60s, Kataba's age was beginning to catch up with her. She knew that her career was nearing its end. After training her successors — and one final mission in 1964 — she was allowed to retire. After that last mission, she was granted a full pardon for her crimes in the '40s, and was also paid enough money to live comfortably for the rest of her life.</p>\n\n<p>She has never spoken about what her final mission entailed, but sometimes jokes that she \"saved the world from nuclear annihilation in the '60s.\" She laughs heartily whenever she tells this joke...but, sometimes, she can be seen staring off into the distance with a melancholy expression on her face, as if she is thinking about sacrifices made by herself — and others — many long years ago.</p>","illustrator":"KattyStarlitt","illustratorUrl":"https://www.deviantart.com/kattystarlitt","groups":["Aishi"],"images":[{"url":"/img/characters/aunt-front-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/aunt-front.png","name":"202X Front"},{"url":"/img/characters/aunt-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/aunt.png","name":"202X Back"},{"url":"/img/characters/aunt-portrait-full.png","thumb":"/img/characters/aunt-portrait.png","name":"1989 Portrait"}]},
